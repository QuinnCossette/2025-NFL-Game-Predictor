# NFL Game Outcome Predictor

This project builds a machine learning model to predict the outcome of NFL games using historical play-by-play and team data.

## Overview

The goal is to predict whether the home team will win a given NFL game. The project uses cleaned data from previous seasons and applies supervised learning techniques to build and evaluate classification models.

## Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing from NFL play-by-play datasets
- Feature engineering for team stats and win conditions
- Model training using Random Forest and Logistic Regression
- Evaluation with accuracy and confusion matrix
- Framework built for future expansion with more advanced models or live data feeds

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the notebook.
2. Open `improved_game_predictor.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
3. Ensure your game data files are correctly loaded (paths reference local Google Drive storage).
4. Run through the cells to process data, train models, and view predictions.

## Notes

- All data is handled locally through Google Drive, so file paths may need to be updated if running elsewhere.
- Model performance can vary season to seasonâ€”this is an exploratory project, not a betting tool.
